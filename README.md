# Title: My portfolio

# Description
This is my portfolio designed using React Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
Reference video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2kGqbzvAn4&t=159s 

Web3forms is used for Contact Form by creating access key for my email. (this access key need not to be put on env file, its public key)

Framer Motion is used for animations in the site.

Vercel is used for deployment. (Abdul's projects/portfolio)

# Instructions 

page.js is the main file that mounts all the components.
layout.js handles the layout of web page.

NOTE: I am using Next.js version 14 and not 15.

## Want to update Image/background Image/Resume?
Just replace old one with new Image/background Image/Resume pdf with the same name.
Example: If old file that you want to update is called `icon.jpg`, then new file should also be named `icon.jpg`.


Resume.pdf is in Public folder
All other media is in assets folder
